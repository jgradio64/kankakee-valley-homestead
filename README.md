This website is an E-commerce website being built for a client. It uses Express.js to handle routing, validation and cookies. It uses node.js on the back end. 

## Current updates being planned and implemented are:
- Implementing a MongoDB database for the storage of products, carts and admin users.
- Add routes to handle the checking-out of orders.
- Add payment functionality using Paypal.
- Store customer address in browser based cookies to improve the ease of checking out for repeate customers.
- Add order API that exports the orders for a given week in an excel file.
